# üöÄ Techstylers Deepdive ‚Äì Cohort 6.0, Cloud Computing With Azure Track
## Capstone Project: Automating Infrastructure Deployment

Welcome to the official repository for **Project Group A** of the **Techstylers Deepdive ‚Äì Cohort 6.0** under the **Cloud Computing with Azure Track**.

This repository contains all the scripts, templates, configurations, documentation, and presentation materials developed by our team as part of the final capstone project titled:

### üí° *Automating Infrastructure Deployment in Microsoft Azure*

The project demonstrates how cloud resources can be provisioned, secured, monitored, and documented using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) practices and Azure-native tools. It was executed as a collaborative simulation of real-world enterprise cloud operations.
